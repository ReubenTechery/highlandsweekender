# 🌲 The Highlands Weekender
An interactive, high-end weekly newsletter experience for the Southern Highlands community.

## 🚀 The Vision
This project replaces the "cookie-cutter" newsletter experience with a bespoke, interactive web app. It’s designed for the local community to find events and "reset" for the weekend with an earthy, premium aesthetic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Custom HTML/CSS/JS (Bento-box layout)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Auto-deployed from GitHub)
- **Audience Management:** beehiiv (Delivery & Growth engine)
- **Automation:** AI-driven scraping and content generation (In progress)

## 🤖 Automation Pipeline (The Techery Way)
1. **Scrape:** AI agents monitor Southern Highlands event calendars.
2. **Synthesize:** Gemini/LLM formats the raw data into the `EVENT_DATA` object.
3. **Deploy:** GitHub Actions/API pushes the update to `index.html`.
4. **Notify:** beehiiv sends a "Teaser" email to subscribers with a link to this site.

## 📁 File Structure
- `index.html`: The main interactive engine (formerly highlandshtml.html).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
